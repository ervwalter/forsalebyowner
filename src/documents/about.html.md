### What Is This?

Every so often, I collect the various unused gadgets and electronics that have built up in and around my home and I sell them for crazy low prices to people I know or that I work with.  I sell them cheaply because I want them to sell fast so that I can get them out of my house.  I sell them locally because I don't want to hassle with shipping things.

### How Do I Buy Something?

There is a "Make An Offer" button on each item's web page.  Click it to send me an email to let me know what you want to buy.

### Payment

If I had payment rules, I'd put them here.  Stuff like not trying to pay with chickens and goats, etc.

### Delivery / Pickup

Since I am selling things locally, I probably would want to put some kind of map here so that you know approximately where you'll have to come to pick them up...
